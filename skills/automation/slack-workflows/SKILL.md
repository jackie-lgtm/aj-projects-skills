## Core Workflows

### 1. Daily Standup Bot

```yaml
workflow: "Async Standup"
schedule: "9:00 AM weekdays"

steps:
  1. send_prompt:
      channel: each team member (DM)
      message: |
        👋 Good morning! Time for standup.
        
        Please share:
        1️⃣ What did you complete yesterday?
        2️⃣ What are you working on today?
        3️⃣ Any blockers?
        
        Reply in this thread 👇
        
  2. collect_responses:
      timeout: 2_hours
      reminder: at_1_hour
      
  3. compile_summary:
      time: "11:00 AM"
      channel: "#team-standup"
      format: |
        📋 *Daily Standup - {date}*
        
        {for_each_member}
        *{name}*
        ✅ Yesterday: {yesterday}
        📌 Today: {today}
        🚧 Blockers: {blockers}
        
        ---
        {end_for}
        
        *Summary:*
        • {total} team members responded
        • {blockers_count} blockers flagged
        
  4. flag_blockers:
      if: blockers_count > 0
      notify: manager
      action: create_thread_for_discussion
```

### 2. Approval Workflow

```yaml
workflow: "Expense Approval"
trigger: form_submission OR slash_command

steps:
  1. receive_request:
      data:
        - requester
        - amount
        - category
        - description
        - receipt_url
        
  2. route_approval:
      rules:
        - if: amount < 100
          approver: direct_manager
          
        - if: amount >= 100 AND amount < 1000
          approver: department_head
          
        - if: amount >= 1000
          approver: [department_head, finance]
          type: sequential
          
  3. send_approval_request:
      channel: DM to approver
      message: |
        📝 *Expense Approval Request*
        
        *From:* {requester}
        *Amount:* ${amount}
        *Category:* {category}
        *Description:* {description}
        
        [View Receipt]({receipt_url})
        
      actions:
        - button: "✅ Approve"
          action: approve
        - button: "❌ Reject"
          action: reject
        - button: "💬 Ask Question"
          action: request_info
          
  4. handle_response:
      approved:
        - notify_requester: "Your expense was approved! 🎉"
        - create_task: in_accounting_system
        - log: in_expense_tracker
        
      rejected:
        - notify_requester: "Expense not approved. Reason: {reason}"
        - log: with_rejection_reason
        
  5. escalate_if_no_response:
