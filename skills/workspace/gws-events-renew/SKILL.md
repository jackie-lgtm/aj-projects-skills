Renew/reactivate Workspace Events subscriptions

## Usage

```bash
gws events +renew
```

## Flags

| Flag | Required | Default | Description |
|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `--name` | — | — | Subscription name to reactivate (e.g., subscriptions/SUB_ID) |
| `--all` | — | — | Renew all subscriptions expiring within --within window |
| `--within` | — | 1h | Time window for --all (e.g., 1h, 30m, 2d) |

## Examples

```bash
gws events +renew --name subscriptions/SUB_ID
gws events +renew --all --within 2d
```

## Tips

- Subscriptions expire if not renewed periodically.
- Use --all with a cron job to keep subscriptions alive.
