## Discovering Commands

Before calling any API method, inspect it:

```bash
# Browse resources and methods
gws modelarmor --help

# Inspect a method's required params, types, and defaults
gws schema modelarmor.<resource>.<method>
```

Use `gws schema` output to build your `--params` and `--json` flags.
