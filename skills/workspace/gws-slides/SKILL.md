# slides (v1)

> **PREREQUISITE (AJ Projects):** First-time setup is at [`../_shared/SETUP.md`](../_shared/SETUP.md). Read it once, then every gws-* skill works automatically.

```bash
gws slides <resource> <method> [flags]
```

## API Resources

### presentations

  - `batchUpdate` — Applies one or more updates to the presentation. Each request is validated before being applied. If any request is not valid, then the entire request will fail and nothing will be applied. Some requests have replies to give you some information about how they are applied. Other requests do not need to return information; these each return an empty reply. The order of replies matches that of the requests.
  - `create` — Creates a blank presentation using the title given in the request. If a `presentationId` is provided, it is used as the ID of the new presentation. Otherwise, a new ID is generated. Other fields in the request, including any provided content, are ignored. Returns the created presentation.
  - `get` — Gets the latest version of the specified presentation.
  - `pages` — Operations on the 'pages' resource

## Discovering Commands

Before calling any API method, inspect it:

```bash
# Browse resources and methods
gws slides --help

# Inspect a method's required params, types, and defaults
gws schema slides.<resource>.<method>
```

Use `gws schema` output to build your `--params` and `--json` flags.
