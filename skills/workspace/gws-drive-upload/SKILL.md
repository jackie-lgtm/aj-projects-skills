# drive +upload

> **PREREQUISITE (AJ Projects):** First-time setup is at [`../_shared/SETUP.md`](../_shared/SETUP.md). Read it once, then every gws-* skill works automatically.

Upload a file with automatic metadata

## Usage

```bash
gws drive +upload <file>
```

## Flags

| Flag | Required | Default | Description |
|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `<file>` | ✓ | — | Path to file to upload |
| `--parent` | — | — | Parent folder ID |
| `--name` | — | — | Target filename (defaults to source filename) |

## Examples

```bash
gws drive +upload ./report.pdf
gws drive +upload ./report.pdf --parent FOLDER_ID
gws drive +upload ./data.csv --name 'Sales Data.csv'
```

## Tips

- MIME type is detected automatically.
- Filename is inferred from the local path unless --name is given.
